# Deployment Documentation for Scientific Calculator

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to deploy a Scientific Calculator web application to GitHub Pages. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and keeps a history of calculations.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- A GitHub repository created for the project
- Access to the GitHub command line interface or GitHub API

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Develop the Application**
   - Ensure the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are correctly set up. The main file is `index.html` which includes the calculator UI and functionality.

2. **Build the Application**
   - The output of the application needs to be built and saved in a directory, typically denoted as `output/build`. Ensure all assets are correctly placed in this directory.

3. **Push Code to GitHub**
   - Run the following commands in your terminal to initialize Git (if not already initialized), add files, commit changes, and push to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit of Scientific Calculator"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Replace `username` and `repository-name` with your GitHub username and your repository name.

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Use the GitHub Pages deployment tool to deploy the content from the build directory:
     ```
     Thought: I need to deploy the code to Github Pages from the output/build directory.
     Action: Deploy to Github Pages
     Action Input: {"build_path": "output/build"}
     ```
   - This action transfers the built application files to GitHub Pages.

5. **Access the Deployed Application**
   - After deploying, you can access your application via the GitHub Pages URL, usually formatted as: `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`.

6. **Verification**
   - Ensure the application is loading correctly in a web browser. Check the functionality of the calculator and the history feature.

## Conclusion
The Scientific Calculator has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible for users. You can further enhance the application by adding more functionalities or improving the UI based on user feedback.
