### Bugs and Issues Found

1. **Division by Zero Error**: 
   - **Description**: When attempting to divide by zero, rather than handling the error, the application crashes.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement error-handling logic to prevent crashes and inform the user of invalid operations.

2. **Responsive Design Flaw**:
   - **Description**: On resizing the window to smaller screen dimensions, some UI elements overflow beyond the calculator borders.
   - **Recommendation**: Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for better responsiveness and ensure elements adjust appropriately.

3. **History Persistence Issue**:
   - **Description**: The calculation history does not persist after refreshing the page.
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure that data is correctly saved to and retrieved from localStorage.
