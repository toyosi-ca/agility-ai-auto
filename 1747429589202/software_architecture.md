**Software Architecture Document for Scientific Calculator**

---

**1. Overview**

The goal of this document is to provide a detailed, simple, and easy-to-implement software solution for the development of a scientific calculator application based on the specified product requirements. This architecture will focus exclusively on the frontend components and employ the local storage API for data persistence. 

**2. Architecture Breakdown**

- **2.1. Technology Stack**
  - **Frontend Framework:** React (or Angular) for building a dynamic user interface.
  - **HTML5** for structuring the content.
  - **CSS3** for styling the components and ensuring a responsive design.
  
- **2.2. Component Structure**

  - **App Component**
    - Main entry point of the application.
  
  - **Calculator Component**
    - Displays the calculator interface.
    - Contains child components for buttons and display.
  
  - **Button Component**
    - Represents a button on the calculator (e.g., numbers, operations).
    - Receives inputs and executes corresponding functions.
  
  - **Display Component**
    - Shows the current input and output.
  
  - **History Component**
    - Displays previous calculations and results. Utilizes local storage to persist the history of calculations.
  
  - **Educational Resources Component**
    - Contains links or content to support users in understanding functions.
  
- **2.3. State Management**
  - Use React's built-in state management to handle user inputs, current calculations, and history.
  - Store and retrieve calculation history using the local storage API.

**3. Functionality Overview**

- **Basic Functions**
  - Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using JavaScript functions.

- **Scientific Functions**
  - Utilize Math library functions for advanced calculations:
    - Trigonometric: `Math.sin()`, `Math.cos()`, `Math.tan()`, etc.
    - Exponential: `Math.exp()`, `Math.pow()`.
    - Logarithmic: `Math.log()`, `Math.log10()`.
    - Factorial: Recursive or iterative function to calculate factorials.
    - Powers and roots: Implement functions for square roots and nth roots.

- **Statistical Functions**
  - Functions to compute mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.

- **Advanced Calculations**
  - Implement operations for complex numbers and matrices (addition, multiplication methods).

- **Graphing Capabilities**
  - Integrate a simple library like Chart.js or D3.js to enable plotting of functions on a graph.

**4. User Interface Design**

- **Responsive Layout**
  - Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
  
- **Touch-Friendly Buttons**
  - Ensure buttons are appropriately sized for touch inputs on mobile devices.

- **Input Display**
  - Maintain a dedicated area for displaying current calculations with clear formatting options (decimal, fraction).

**5. Data Persistence with Local Storage**

- Implement functions to save the calculation history in the local storage.
- Provide options for users to clear history when desired.

**6. Security Considerations**

- Ensure that no personal user data is stored other than calculation history.
- Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.

**7. Testing Strategy**

- Conduct unit tests on each function to confirm accuracy of calculations.
- Perform integration tests on UI components to ensure smooth navigation and functionality.
- Implement performance tests to ensure the application meets the loading times outlined in the PRD.

**8. Future Enhancements**

- Explore the integration of voice recognition for inputting calculations.
- Consider implementing AI features for step-by-step solutions.
- Potential collaboration features for study groups or session sharing.

**9. Acceptance Criteria**

- All functional tests must confirm that basic and scientific functions operate accurately.
- The UI must be consistent, intuitive, and responsive across different devices.
- Must meet performance benchmarks outlined in the PRD.
- Ensure educational resources are integrated and function as intended.
