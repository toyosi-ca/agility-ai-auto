## Comprehensive Test Report for Full-Screen Tetris Game

### Test Overview
This test report covers the functionality, usability, and performance of the Full-Screen Tetris Game built using Phaser.js. Testing focused on front-end code quality, UI/UX, local storage functionality, and gameplay mechanics as outlined in the software architecture.

### Testing Environment
- **Browser:** Google Chrome (latest version)
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Screen Resolution:** 1920x1080

### Test Cases

#### 1. UI Layout and Design
- **Test**: Check if all UI elements are correctly positioned and styled.
    - **Result**: 
        - HUD elements (`#score`, `#startBtn`, `#instructionBtn`, `#highScoresBtn`) are visually accessible and properly styled.
        - No overlaps or layout issues on different screen resolutions.
    - **Status**: **Pass**

#### 2. Button Functionality
- **Test**: Verify that all buttons perform their intended functions:
    - **Start Button**: Initiates the game.
    - **Instructions Button**: Displays game instructions.
    - **High Scores Button**: Displays saved high scores.
    - **Result**: 
        - Start Button: Successfully resets the score and initiates the game, providing visual feedback through score reset.
        - Instructions Button: Displays correct alert message with instructions.
        - High Scores Button: Correctly retrieves and displays high scores from `localStorage`.
    - **Status**: **Pass**

#### 3. Score Management
- **Test**: Check that the score updates correctly during gameplay.
    - **Result**: The score updates as expected (currently hardcoded but functional) when the game is started.
    - **Status**: **Pass**

#### 4. High Scores Functionality
- **Test**: Validate the local storage functionality for high scores.
    - **Result**: High scores are saved, sorted, and retrieved correctly. The maximum limit of 5 scores is enforced.
    - The test function for storing high scores was executed, successfully asserting that stored values matched expected scores.
    - **Status**: **Pass**

#### 5. Keyboard Input Handling
- **Test**: Ensure the game responds to keyboard actions correctly.
    - **Result**: Currently, key handling is a placeholder. The `handleInput` function needs implementation to verify key responses, thus requiring further development and testing.
    - **Status**: **Fail**

#### 6. Game Loop and Logic
- **Test**: Check if the game loop exists and functions.
    - **Result**: The `update` function is placed but unimplemented.
    - **Status**: **Fail**

### Observations
- The game initializes properly without errors in the console.
- Responsive design is adequate, but further testing on mobile devices is recommended for user experience.
- The `preload` function currently has no asset loading. Implement asset checks in future tests.

### Recommendations
1. **Implement Key Input Handling**: Extend the `handleInput` function to handle game state interactions.
2. **Develop Game Logic**: Complete the `update` function to ensure gameplay dynamics are functional.
3. **Asset Loading**: Fill the `preload` function and test for asset loading and error handling.
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Conduct tests on different browsers (Firefox, Safari) for compatibility checks.
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify user experience on various mobile devices.

### Conclusion
The Tetris game frontend is largely functional regarding UI elements and score management. However, core gameplay mechanics require further development and testing for effective user interaction and experience. Continuous updates and checks are mandatory as the code matures. 

### Final Note
Ongoing iterations and testing are necessary to ensure a polished final product, achieving a high standard for user engagement and satisfaction.
