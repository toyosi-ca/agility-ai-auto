# Deployment Documentation for Book Store Inventory

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to deploy the Book Store Inventory application to GitHub Pages. This is a frontend application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage a simple book inventory. 

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a GitHub account.
2. Install Git on your machine.
3. Familiarity with the command line and Git commands.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/book-store-inventory.git
cd book-store-inventory
```

## Step 2: Build the Project
Assuming you have the build process set up (for example, using a build tool like Webpack), run the build command to create the production-ready code. Make sure the output is directed to the `output/build` directory.

```bash
# Example of a build command
npm run build
```

## Step 3: Push the Code to GitHub
After ensuring that your code is ready, add all your changes and commit them.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

## Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Now that your code is pushed to GitHub, we will deploy the code from the `output/build` directory to GitHub Pages. This can be done using a specific deployment command or via a GUI (GitHub interface).
```python
# Use the command to deploy to GitHub Pages
Deploy to Github Pages
{
    "build_path": "output/build"
}
```

## Step 5: Verify Deployment
After a successful deployment, visit `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/book-store-inventory/` to view your application live.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! Your Book Store Inventory application is now live on GitHub Pages. You can make changes to your code, and repeat the push and deployment process whenever necessary.
