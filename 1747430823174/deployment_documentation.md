## Overview
This document provides comprehensive steps to deploy the Gideon Peters landing page to GitHub Pages using the output/build directory.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account.
- Git installed on your local machine.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Prepare Your Project
Ensure that your landing page is ready and all necessary files are generated in the output/build directory. The landing page should comply with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript standards.

### 2. Initialize Git Repository
If you haven't already, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and initialize a new git repository:
```bash
git init
```

### 3. Commit Your Code
Add all your files to the repository and commit the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Gideon Peters Landing Page"
```

### 4. Push to GitHub
Create a new repository on GitHub, then link your local repository to the remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Now that your code is pushed to GitHub, you can deploy it to GitHub Pages. Use the following tool to deploy:
```
Action: Deploy to Github Pages
Action Input: {"build_path":"output/build"}
```

### 6. Verify Deployment
After deployment, go to `https://username.github.io/repository-name/` to see your landing page live. Make sure to replace `username` and `repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and the name of the repository.

## Testing the Features
Ensure that all features work correctly:
