## Overview
This document outlines the steps necessary to deploy the Full-Screen Tetris Game to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- A local copy of the Tetris game project

## Steps for Deployment

### 1. Build Your Project
Ensure that your project is ready for deployment. That means all necessary files should be in the `output/build` directory. This directory should contain an `index.html` file and any other assets the game requires.

### 2. Push the Code to GitHub
If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository, commit your files, and push them to your GitHub repository. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```
Replace `USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Deploy the content from the `output/build` directory to GitHub Pages using the deployment tool.

```python
