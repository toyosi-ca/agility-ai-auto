# Deployment Documentation for Musician Name Official Site

This document outlines the steps taken to deploy the official site for Musician Name to GitHub Pages. The deployment process utilizes the build directory, containing all necessary files, and employs GitHub's Pages service for web hosting.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Account
- GitHub Repository
- Node.js and npm (for local development if needed)
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code

Ensure your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes are correctly structured in your project directory. The key files are:

1. **index.html** - Main entry point of the website
2. **styles.css** - CSS for styling the website
3. **script.js** - JavaScript file for functionality

An example of the `index.html` file structure is provided below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Landing page for Musician Name, promoting brand and music.">
    <title>Musician Name - Official Site</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content Here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Build Your Project

If using a frontend framework or build tool, run the build command to generate the output in the `output/build` directory. Ensure all necessary static files are included.

## Step 3: Version Control with Git

1. Initialize a Git repository if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add your files to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Musician Name Official Site"
   ```

## Step 4: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `musician-name-official-site`).
3. Follow the instructions to push your local repository to GitHub.

## Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once the code is pushed to the GitHub repository, execute the deployment process using the build directory.

1. **Deploying to GitHub Pages:**
   - Utilize the `Deploy to Github Pages` functionality:
   
```json
{
  "build_path": "output/build"
}
```
   
This command will deploy the contents of the `output/build` directory to your GitHub Pages.

## Step 6: Access Your Deployed Site

- After the deployment process is completed (it should take a few moments), your site should be accessible at:
  ```
  https://<username>.github.io/musician-name-official-site/
  ```

## Conclusion

Your site is now live on GitHub Pages! Ensure that you check all functionalities, including the music player, newsletter signup, and links to social media. Make updates as necessary by modifying the files, committing changes, and redeploying.
