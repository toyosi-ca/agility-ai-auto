### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Objectives  
To provide a detailed yet straightforward architecture for the HR system that leverages local storage to manage data persistence efficiently while ensuring an intuitive user experience for HR managers, employees, and recruiters.

#### 1.2 Architecture Overview  
The HR system is designed as a single-page application (SPA) strictly leveraging frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and utilizing the browserâ€™s Local Storage API for data persistence. This architecture ensures fast data retrieval and storage without requiring backend services.

### 2. System Components

#### 2.1 User Interface  
The user interface will be organized into the following sections:
- Employee Self-Service Portal: Allowing employees to manage their personal data and submit feedback.
- HR Management Dashboard: A comprehensive view for HR managers to manage employee records and recruitment.
- Recruitment Management Dashboard: For recruiters to handle job postings and track applications.
- Performance Management Interface: For setting performance goals and collecting reviews.

#### 2.2 Local Storage Management  
The application will use the Local Storage API to store data locally within the user's browser. Data will be structured in JSON format and segregated by modules:
- `employees`: For storing employee records.
- `applications`: For recruitment data.
- `performance`: For performance appraisals.
  
Example structure:  
```json
{
  "employees": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "position": "Developer", "email": "john@example.com" }
  ],
  "applications": [
    { "jobId": 101, "candidateName": "Jane Smith", "status": "Applied" }
  ],
  "performance": [
    { "employeeId": 1, "goals": [], "feedback": [] }
  ]
}
```

#### 2.3 Business Logic  
Business logic will be implemented within JavaScript functions that interact with the Local Storage to handle CRUD operations. For instance:
- **Add Employee**: Validate input and add employee data to Local Storage.
- **Update Profile**: Retrieve employee data for updates and save changes.
- **Post Job Listing**: Enable recruiters to enter job details and save them in Local Storage.

### 4. Security Considerations  
- User authentication and session management could be implemented using tokens stored in Local Storage.
- Ensure access control is defined by roles for viewing and editing sensitive data.
- Data should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

---

### 5. Usability and Performance Indicators  
- Responsive design for compatibility with various devices.
- Fast load times and smooth transitions to enhance user experience.
