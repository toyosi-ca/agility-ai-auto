# Software Architecture Document for Book Store Inventory Application

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a detailed architecture for a web-based Book Store Inventory Application based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD). The focus is solely on the frontend aspect of the application, utilizing local storage to satisfy data persistence requirements, and providing a clean, user-friendly interface for inventory management.

## 2. Functional Breakdown

### 2.1 Application Structure

The application will be built using **React.js** for its component-driven architecture, allowing for reusable UI components that can manage the different functionalities of the application easily. The overall architecture involves:

- **Components**: To represent various UI elements and logic.
   - `BookForm`: For adding and editing book details.
   - `BookList`: To list books along with options to edit and delete.
   - `SearchBar`: A component to search for books based on title, author, or ISBN.
   - `Filter`: To filter books by categories.
   - `Report`: To generate and display inventory reports.

### 2.2 Local Storage Management

The application will use the **Local Storage API** for data persistence. This will allow the app to save, retrieve, and manipulate book data without the need for a backend server. The local storage will hold an array of book objects where each book can have the following attributes:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "title": "Book Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "category": "Category Name",
  "isbn": "ISBN Number",
  "quantity": "Available Quantity"
}
```

### 2.3 State Management

Utilizing React’s state management capabilities, the application will maintain:
- A global state for the list of books, using React’s Context API for easy access to component tree.
- Local component state for form inputs to manage user input smoothly.

### 2.4 Rendering and Event Handling

1. **Adding a Book**:
   - Store Manager fills out the `BookForm` component.
   - On submission, the book details will be pushed to the local storage and globally updated in the `BookList` component.

2. **Editing a Book**:
   - Users can select an existing book from the `BookList`, populate the `BookForm` with its existing details.
   - After modifications, the book data in local storage will be updated accordingly.

3. **Deleting a Book**:
   - Each book in the `BookList` will have a delete button that, when clicked, will remove the book from local storage and update the displayed list.

4. **Searching and Filtering**:
   - The `SearchBar` component filters through the book list based on user input.
   - The `Filter` component will retrieve books belonging to a selected category from the local storage.

5. **Generating Reports**:
   - The `Report` component will aggregate data from local storage to display inventory status and sales trends, enabling export functionality as a downloadable CSV file.

## 3. User Interface Design

### 3.1 Layout

- A **responsive design** using Flexbox or CSS Grid will be implemented to ensure usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- The UI will include:
  - A header section with the app title and navigation links.
  - A main content area that displays the `BookList`, forms, search, and filter components.
  - A footer with additional information and links.

### 3.2 Styling

- Use of CSS Modules or Styled-components with a consistent color scheme and typography to enhance UI aesthetics.
- Incorporate animations for adding/editing books to create a dynamic user experience.

## 4. Performance and Optimization

### 4.1 Load Optimization

- Implement code-splitting in React to improve load times, only loading the components that are required.
- Utilize lazy loading for images of book covers if they are part of the implementation to enhance performance.

### 4.2 Testing

- Unit testing with *Jest* and component testing with *React Testing Library* to ensure that all functional requirements are met before deployment.

## 5. Security

- As this application uses local storage, sensitive information should not be stored. Emphasis should be placed on validating input to prevent malicious data entry.

## 6. Conclusion

This architecture provides a comprehensive and straightforward approach to building a Book Store Inventory Application on the frontend, ensuring usability for both store managers and staff members while effectively managing the inventory through local storage. By adhering to this design, developers will be able to create a functional, responsive, and aesthetic application that meets the outlined requirements. 

This document will serve as a guide throughout the development process, ensuring that the vision from the PRD is realized effectively. The final outcome will be an easy-to-use application that efficiently manages a book store's inventory.
