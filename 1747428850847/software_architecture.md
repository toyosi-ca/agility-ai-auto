# Software Architecture Document for "Test" Product

## Overview
This software architecture document outlines a simple, frontend-only solution for the "Test" product as per the product requirements document (PRD). The design leverages the local storage API for data persistence, ensuring an intuitive user experience without backend dependencies. 

## Architecture Components
1. **User Interface (UI) Framework**: 
   - Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Frameworks: For styling and component management, consider using libraries such as Bootstrap for responsive design and simple UI components.

2. **Local Storage for Data Persistence**:
   - The product will utilize the localStorage API for persisting test cases, execution results, and user sessions securely within the user's browser, allowing immediate access without server interaction.

## Detailed Component Architecture

### 1. Dashboard Component
  - **Purpose**: To give users an overview of test statuses and metrics.
  - **Functionalities**:
    - Fetch and display data (test summaries, recent activity, alerts) from local storage.
    - Implement filtering options using JavaScript to sort data by date, project, or team members.
    
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Create an HTML structure to outline sections.
    - Use CSS for styling and responsiveness.
    - Utilize JavaScript for dynamic data fetching and filtering from local storage.

### 2. Test Creation Module
  - **Purpose**: To allow users to create new test cases.
  - **Functionalities**:
    - Form for inputting Title, Description, Precondition Setup, Test Steps, and Expected Results.
    - Option to attach documents or files (this can only be simulated by adding file names to local storage).

  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Create a form with input fields and an attachment option.
    - Implement JavaScript event listeners for form submission to store data in local storage and reset the form after submission.

### 3. Test Execution Module
  - **Purpose**: To execute tests with a one-click operation.
  - **Functionalities**:
    - Buttons for manual and automated test executions.
    - Real-time feedback on test outcomes (PASS/FAIL).

  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Use JavaScript functions to update test status in local storage based on user actions.
    - Create UI elements that reflect test execution status dynamically.

### 4. Reporting Interface
  - **Purpose**: To generate customizable reports based on test executions.
  - **Functionalities**:
    - Display test result statistics over time.
    - Enable data export options (CSV, PDF) through third-party libraries.
  
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Implement graphical representation using chart libraries (e.g., Chart.js).
    - Format data fetched from local storage for reporting.

### 5. User Authentication
  - **Purpose**: To secure user sessions and functionalities.
  - **Functionalities**:
    - Simulate an authentication process using local storage to maintain user sessions and roles.
    
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Create a simple login form with user credentials.
    - Store user session data in local storage upon logging in and check for it on page load.

### 6. Collaboration Features 
  - **Purpose**: To facilitate teamwork during testing.
  - **Functionalities**:
    - Include a commenting section for each test case and notifications for updates.
    
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Utilize local storage to save comments and notifications, allowing a simple retrieval on UI updates.

## Security Considerations
- Implement basic security by ensuring sensitive data stored in local storage is minimized.
- Adhere to a minimal data collection approach to comply with regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

## Performance & Scalability
- Ensure all components load and respond within 2 seconds.
- Design UI to handle up to 1,000 concurrent users by managing local storage efficiently and minimizing DOM updates.

## Usability Enhancements
- Provide in-app tooltips and help sections for user assistance.
- Ensure designs are mobile-friendly for access on various devices.

## Conclusion
The proposed architecture provides a simple yet comprehensive solution for the "Test" product. Leveraging local storage for persistence ensures that users can efficiently create, manage, and execute tests without needing backend support. This frontend-only design framework aligns closely with the outlined goals and objectives in the PRD, focusing on usability, performance, and future scalability. 

Stakeholder collaboration will be pivotal for refining usability and ensuring successful testing prior to launch.
