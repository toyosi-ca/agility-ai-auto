# Deployment Documentation for Test Product

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to push the code to GitHub and deploy the Test Product to GitHub Pages. The Test Product is a straightforward web application designed for test management, allowing users to create, execute, and report on tests through an interactive dashboard.

## Requirements
1. A GitHub account with permissions to create repositories.
2. Git installed on your machine.
3. Node.js and npm installed (if building from source).
4. A build directory containing the production-ready files.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Setting Up Your Project
Make sure the project files are organized properly with the build located in the `output/build` directory.

### 2. Initialize Git and Create a Repository
If not already done, navigate to your project directory and initialize a git repository:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
```
Create a new repository on GitHub.

### 3. Add Remote Repository
Add your GitHub repository as a remote:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

### 4. Push Code to GitHub
Add all files to the staging area and commit the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Test Product"
```
Push the code to the master/main branch of the repository:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Deploy the built code located in the `output/build` directory to GitHub Pages. 
- Use the tool designed for deployment:
```
Deploy to Github Pages
```
  **Action Input:** `{"build_path":"output/build"}`

### 6. Verify Deployment
After deployment, navigate to `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepository` to see your Test Product live.

## Post-Deployment
- Ensure your dashboard loads successfully and all functionalities are working as intended.
- Conduct testing on the deployed application to verify its performance in the live environment.

## Troubleshooting
- Check console for any errors if the application does not load correctly.
- Verify paths and the build directory if files are missing.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will successfully push the Test Product code to GitHub and deploy it to GitHub Pages, making it accessible to users online.
