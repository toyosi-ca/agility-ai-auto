### 1. Functionality Testing

#### Home Page
- Ensure that the "Home" page loads by default upon opening the application.
- All navigation links should lead to corresponding pages without errors.

#### Sign Up
- Test valid user registration.
- Test invalid user registration (e.g., duplicate username).
- Confirm that success and error messages are displayed appropriately.

**Bugs Found:**
- Upon trying to sign up with a duplicate username, it displays the error message but does not prevent the form from being successfully submitted (should return false).

#### Login
- Test valid login with correct credentials.
- Test invalid login scenarios (incorrect username/password).
- Confirm that successful login redirects the user to the Dashboard.

**Bugs Found:**
- Incorrect handling of login failure does not clear input fields for security (previous password can still be seen).

#### Dashboard
- Ensure that all buttons (Create Test, Take Test) function properly and transition smoothly between necessary pages.

### 2. Usability Testing
- Verify that the navigation is user-friendly and intuitive.
- Check that all form elements (input fields, buttons) are clearly labeled and have proper placeholder text.
- Confirm that error messages are clear and user-friendly.

**Bugs Found:**
- An unclear placeholder in the "Create a Test" segment regarding what users should input for dataset or question information.

### 3. Performance Testing
- Test the loading times for each page.
- Monitor for any lag in response during transitions and button clicks.

**Findings:**
- Slight delay observed when loading the Dashboard after login. Optimization may be required for user data retrieval.

### 4. Responsiveness Testing
- Use Developer Tools to adjust browser sizes. 
- Ensure layout adjusts for various screen sizes (mobile vs. desktop).

**Findings:**
- All elements are responsive, but navigation links overlap in smaller screens.

### 5. Security Testing
- Validate the hashing of passwords for the sign-up and login functionalities.
- Attempt to access local storage data directly via the console.

**Findings:**
- Password hashing using `btoa()` is not sufficient for security and needs to be replaced with a more secure hashing method.

### 6. Cross-browser Compatibility Testing
- Test application on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Verify consistency in appearance and functionality.

**Bugs Found:**
- Minor CSS issues (padding/margins) causing layout problems in Firefox.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
The frontend application is functional with several areas for improvement. The major issues revolve around form handling, security, and usability. Here are the recommended actions:

1. **Improve Error Handling:** Ensure forms handle validation errors appropriately and remove sensitive data before submission.
2. **Enhance Security Measures:** Replace password hashing with a more secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
3. **Optimize Loading Times:** Investigate the delay in loading user data and enhance performance.
4. **CSS Adjustments:** Make necessary adjustments in CSS for better cross-browser layout compatibility.
5. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Refine the navigation links for various display sizes to prevent overlap.
  
By addressing these areas, the frontend code can be significantly enhanced to provide a better user experience and robust application security.
