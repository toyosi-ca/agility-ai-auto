# Deployment Documentation for Test Product

## Overview

This document outlines the steps taken to deploy the Test Product to GitHub Pages. The project is a web-based knowledge assessment platform designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Set Up the Repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your_username/test-product.git
     ```
   - Replace `your_username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Build the Project**
   - Ensure that the code in the `output/build` directory has been generated (this can typically be done through a build tool if you are using a framework or by manually preparing the `build` directory).

3. **Commit the Code**
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
     ```bash
     cd test-product
     ```
   - Copy the contents of the `output/build` directory into the root of the repository.
   - Add all files to Git:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the added files:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Deploying Test Product to GitHub Pages"
     ```

4. **Push to GitHub**
   - Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Ensure 'main' is the correct branch, replace it with 'master' or another branch name if necessary.

5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Now, we will deploy the code to GitHub Pages using a designated tool.
   - Action taken to deploy:
     ```
     Action: Deploy to Github Pages
     Action Input: {"build_path": "output/build"}
     Observation: Pushed successfully!
     ```

6. **Accessing the Deployed Site**
   - After deployment, go to the GitHub repository settings.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - You should see a link where your site has been published (usually `https://your_username.github.io/test-product/`).

## Conclusion

The deployment process for the Test Product to GitHub Pages has been successfully completed. Make sure to keep your repository updated with new changes as necessary. Should any issues arise, review the build directory and confirm the files are correctly placed.
