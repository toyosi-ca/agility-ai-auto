### Software Architecture Document for "Test" Product

#### 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the "Test" product, focusing solely on frontend implementation while utilizing local storage for data persistence. The goal is to create a streamlined and user-friendly application that efficiently assesses user knowledge through various testing formats.

#### 2. Architectural Components

##### 2.1 User Interface (UI)
**Framework:** React.js (or vanilla JavaScript for simplicity)  
**Styling:** CSS/Bootstrap for responsive design

**Pages and Features:**
- **Home Page:**
  - Welcome message
  - Navigation to Sign Up and Login

- **Sign Up / Login Page:**
  - Form fields for user credentials
  - Validation feedback and error handling

- **Dashboard Page:**
  - Options to Create or Take a Test
  - Access to User Stats and History

- **Test Creation Page:**
  - Display of a Question Bank 
  - Interface to Select Question Types
    - Multiple Choice
    - True/False
    - Short Answer
  - Save option to store tests locally using `localStorage`

- **Test Taking Page:**
  - Presents questions based on the selected test
  - Timer functionality for timed assessments
  - Submit button to finalize the test and process results

- **Results and Analytics Page:**
  - Immediate feedback on test performance
  - Summary report capturing average score, time taken, and identified strengths/weaknesses
  - Option to restart or take new tests

- **Admin Dashboard Page:**
  - Overview of user activity and test performance trends
  - Accessible only to admin users, leveraging user role management through local storage

##### 2.2 Data Management
**Data Handling:** Use of local storage API  
- Store user profiles, test results, and analytics data.
- JSON format to easily serialize and deserialize data for storage. 

Examples of local storage usage:
```javascript
// Save User Data
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({ username: 'JohnDoe', password: 'hashedPass' }));

// Save Test Results
localStorage.setItem('testResults', JSON.stringify({ testId: '123', score: 85, elapsedTime: 30 }));

// Retrieve Data
const userData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
const testResults = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('testResults'));
```

#### 3. Functional Requirements Breakdown

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionalities using local storage for credential management. Simple hashing for password storage, ensuring security compliance.
  
- **Test Creation:** Users select questions from a predefined bank and save tests using local storage for future access. Incorporates validation to ensure all fields are filled correctly.

- **Test Taking:** High usability interface for taking tests, implementing a timer feature to limit assessment duration.

- **Results and Analytics:** Immediate feedback allows users to analyze their performance effectively. Store metrics locally for personalized insights.

- **Admin Dashboard:** A restricted area for monitoring user tests, providing insights into usage trends and application performance.

#### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the application loads quickly (within 2 seconds).
  
- **Scalability:** The frontend should support responding quickly to user actions; utilize event delegation to manage multiple events effectively.

- **Security:** Use best practices for client-side data handling, ensuring any sensitive information is not directly exposed in local storage.

- **Usability:** Efforts in UI/UX design should target accessibility, ensuring the platformâ€™s usability for all demographics.
