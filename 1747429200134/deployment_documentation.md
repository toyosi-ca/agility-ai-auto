# Deployment Documentation for Test Product

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to deploy the Test Product to Github Pages. The deployment process includes pushing the code to a GitHub repository and then setting up GitHub Pages to serve the frontend application. 

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- A working directory containing your project (the output/build directory) 

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare the Project

1. Ensure your project is structured properly and contains all necessary files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Build your project (if necessary) and place the output files in the `output/build` directory.

### Step 2: Initialize Git

If you haven't already, initialize a new Git repository:

git init
```

### Step 3: Commit Your Code

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

Replace `username` and `repository-name` with your GitHub username and the name of your new repository.

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

Push the code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 7: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Use the following command to deploy your build directory to GitHub Pages:

```json
{
  "build_path": "output/build"
}
```

### Step 8: Access Your Deployed Application

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your application at:

```
https://username.github.io/repository-name
```
