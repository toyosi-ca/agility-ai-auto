# Deployment Documentation for Temperature Converter

## Overview
This document outlines the steps necessary to deploy the Temperature Converter application to GitHub Pages. The application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Node.js and npm installed for building the project
- A local environment set up to run and test the application before deployment

## Project Structure
Ensure your project has the following structure:
```
/temperature-converter
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── script.js
```

## Building the Application
To prepare your application for deployment, ensure that it is built into a production-ready static site. If you haven’t set this up yet, you can use any static site generator or just ensure that your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all in the correct output/build directory.

1. **Build the project** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command should generate the necessary files in the `output/build` directory.

## Pushing Code to GitHub
Once you are ready to deploy, ensure your code is committed to a GitHub repository:

1. Initialize a git repository if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add your files to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Link your local repository to a GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

5. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
Now that the code is pushed, proceed to deploy it to GitHub Pages. 

Using the build path, deploy the application as follows:

```
Action: Deploy to Github Pages
Action Input: {"build_path":"output/build"}
```

Upon successful execution, your application will be live on GitHub Pages.

## Accessing the Deployed Application
The application should now be accessible at:
```
https://username.github.io/repository-name/
```

## Conclusion
This documentation provides the necessary steps to deploy the Temperature Converter application to GitHub Pages. Ensure you follow best practices for continuous integration and version control as you develop the application further.
