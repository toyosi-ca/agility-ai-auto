# Deployment Documentation for Temperature Converter

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to deploy the Temperature Converter application to GitHub Pages, ensuring it is available for users to access online.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account.
- Git installed on your local machine.
- A local copy of the Temperature Converter project with its build files located in the `output/build` directory.
- Access to GitHub API for deployment.

## Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Prepare Your Local Project
1. Ensure that your project is complete and that you have an `output/build` directory with the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files ready for deployment.

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository
If you haven't already initialized a Git repository in your project folder:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
```

### Step 3: Commit Your Changes
Add and commit your changes to the repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Temperature Converter"
```

### Step 4: Push Code to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (do this on the GitHub website).
2. Once the repository is created, follow these instructions:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
git push -u origin main
```
Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of your repository.

### Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages
With the code in your repository and the build files ready, use the GitHub Pages deployment tool:
