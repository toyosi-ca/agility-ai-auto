# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Temperature Converter

**Product Title:** Temperature Converter

**Prepared By:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Current Date]

## 1. Purpose
The objective of this document is to outline the requirements for a Temperature Converter application that allows users to easily convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This document will serve as a guide for the development team in building a user-friendly and efficient product.

## 2. Background
Temperature conversion is a common task in science, engineering, cooking, and daily life. Users often need to convert temperature values from one scale to another for various applications, including weather reporting, cooking recipes, and scientific calculations. The Temperature Converter aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users, enabling quick and accurate conversions.

## 3. Scope
The Temperature Converter will be a web-based application accessible on desktop and mobile devices. It will provide users with three input fields for entering temperature values in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, with the ability to convert a selected temperature to the other two scales.

### 3.1 Features
- **Input Fields:** Three input fields for Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K).
- **Conversion Logic:** Implement mathematical formulas for conversion:
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit: \( F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \)
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius: \( C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \)
  - Celsius to Kelvin: \( K = C + 273.15 \)
  - Kelvin to Celsius: \( C = K - 273.15 \)
  - Fahrenheit to Kelvin: \( K = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273.15 \)
  - Kelvin to Fahrenheit: \( F = (K - 273.15) \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \)
- **Convert Button:** A button to trigger the conversion process.
- **Result Display:** After conversion, display the results in the appropriate output fields with the corresponding unit labels.
- **Clear Button:** A button to clear the input and output fields for new conversions.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Design will ensure usability across all device sizes.
- **User Experience:** Maintain a clean and simple user interface with clear labels and instructions.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The application should respond to user input and provide conversion results in less than one second.
- **Usability:** The interface must be intuitive, ensuring even non-technical users can perform conversions effortlessly within three clicks.
- **Accessibility:** The application should comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
- **Multilingual Support:** The application should support at least English and Spanish for wider audience reach.

## 4. User Stories
1. As a user, I want to input a temperature in Celsius and receive the equivalent in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
2. As a user, I want to input a temperature in Fahrenheit and receive the equivalent in Celsius and Kelvin.
3. As a user, I want to input a temperature in Kelvin and receive the equivalent in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
4. As a user, I want to easily reset my input and output fields to perform a new conversion without refreshing the page.

## 5. Metrics for Success
- User satisfaction score of 90% or above based on feedback after one month of launch.
- At least 1000 unique users within the first three months.
- An average response time of less than 1 second for conversion calculations.

## 6. Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1:** Design the user interface (UI) focusing on UX principles and accessibility.
- **Phase 2:** Develop the core functionality to handle temperature conversions.
- **Phase 3:** Implement additional features such as multilingual support and responsive design.
- **Phase 4:** Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments before the public launch.
- **Phase 5:** Release the product and monitor user interactions to enhance functionality and performance based on real-world usage.
