# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Temperature Converter

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a Temperature Converter application that allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of the Temperature Converter is to provide users with a simple and efficient tool to convert temperatures between different units, facilitating their understanding and usage in various contexts, such as scientific calculations, cooking, travel, and daily activities.

## 3. Scope
- The Temperature Converter will be a web-based application.
- It will support the conversion between the following temperature scales:
  - Celsius (°C)
  - Fahrenheit (°F)
  - Kelvin (K)
- Users will be able to input a temperature, select the from and to units, and receive the converted temperature as output.
- Additional features will include error handling for invalid inputs and a user-friendly interface.

## 4. Stakeholders
- Product Manager
- UX/UI Designers
- Software Developers
- Quality Assurance Team
- End Users (general public, students, professionals)

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 User Interface
- **Input Field**: A numeric input field where users can enter the temperature value they want to convert.
- **Drop-Down Menus**: 
  - One menu to select the original temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
  - Another menu to select the target temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
- **Convert Button**: A button that the user can click to perform the conversion.
- **Output Field**: A display area to show the converted temperature value.
- **Error Message Display**: An area to display error messages for invalid input.

### 5.2 User Interaction
- Users can click on the convert button to trigger the conversion process.
- If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric characters), an appropriate error message should inform the user.

### 5.3 Calculation Logic
- **Celsius to Fahrenheit**: \( F = (C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32 \)
- **Celsius to Kelvin**: \( K = C + 273.15 \)
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius**: \( C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \)
- **Fahrenheit to Kelvin**: \( K = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273.15 \)
- **Kelvin to Celsius**: \( C = K - 273.15 \)
- **Kelvin to Fahrenheit**: \( F = (K - 273.15) \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \)

### 5.4 Additional Features
- **History of Conversions**: An optional feature that stores the last five conversion results for user reference.
- **Unit Explanation**: On hover over the unit selectors, brief explanations of each temperature scale.

### 5.5 Compatibility
- The application should be compatible with major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The conversion should occur within 1 second of clicking the convert button.
- **Usability**: The interface should be simple and intuitive, requiring no prior knowledge to use.
- **Accessibility**: The application should comply with WCAG 2.1 standards for accessibility.

## 7. User Acceptance Criteria
- The application successfully converts temperatures between the three scales.
- Users can easily understand how to use the application without additional instructions.
- Error messages appear promptly for invalid inputs.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Number of users utilizing the converter per month.
- User feedback and satisfaction scores collected via surveys.
- Number of successful conversions versus the number of attempts.

## 9. Timeline
- Design Phase: 2 weeks
- Development Phase: 4 weeks
- Testing Phase: 2 weeks
- Final Review and Launch: 1 week

## 10. Conclusion
This PRD outlines the essential requirements for the Temperature Converter application. It aims to deliver a reliable, user-friendly tool that meets the needs of casual users and professionals alike in converting temperatures across various scales. Following this document will ensure clarity in development and fulfillment of client expectations.
