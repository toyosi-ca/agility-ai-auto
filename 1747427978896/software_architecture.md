# Software Architecture Document for "Test"

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the detailed software architecture for the "Test" product, which aims to provide users with a robust testing tool featuring both automated and manual testing capabilities, comprehensive reporting, user management, and a user-friendly interface.

## 2. Architecture Design

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The architecture is a single-page application (SPA) utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (such as React, Angular, or Vue.js) for the frontend implementation. The application will leverage the Local Storage API to persist data in the user's browser.

#### Components:
- **User Interface (UI) Layer**: Manages the application layout, navigation, and user interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Implements core functionalities including test case creation, execution, reporting, and user management.
- **Data Layer**: Utilizes Local Storage for data persistence (e.g., storing test cases, results, user preferences).

### 2.2 Component Breakdown

#### 2.2.1 User Interface (UI)
- **Navigation**: A responsive menu that allows users to navigate between automated testing, manual testing, reporting, and user management sections.
- **Automated Testing Interface**: Provide form inputs to create and schedule automated tests in preferred languages (Java, Python, JavaScript).
- **Manual Testing Interface**: Simple forms for creating, managing, and executing manual test cases.
- **Reporting Dashboard**: A visual representation of test results with options to filter, export (HTML, CSV format only), and analyze data.
- **User Management UI**: Interfaces for user registration, login (single sign-on with options for 2FA), and role-based access controls.

#### 2.2.2 Business Logic Layer
- **Test Management**: Functions to create, edit, delete, and validate test scripts and cases, both automated and manual.
- **Reporting Functions**: Logic to aggregate and compute test results, including pass/fail statistics and visual graphs for dashboard representation.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementation of user management functions that handle user registration, role assignments, and permissions.

#### 2.2.3 Data Layer
- Utilize browser Local Storage to persist:
  - Test cases and configurations
  - User profiles and permissions
  - Test results and reports
- Data follows JSON structure for ease of management:
  ```json
  {
    "testCases": [],
    "users": [],
    "results": []
  }
  ```

### 2.3 Data Persistence Strategies
- **Local Storage Operations**:
  - Store, retrieve, update, and delete test case scripts and results as JSON strings.
  - Implement helper functions to manage Local Storage interactions:
    - `saveToLocalStorage(key, data)`: Saves data to local storage.
    - `getFromLocalStorage(key)`: Retrieves data from local storage.
    - `removeFromLocalStorage(key)`: Deletes specified data from local storage.

## 3. User Stories Implementation
- **Automated Tests**: Developers will use the interface to create tests in their preferred languages. Validations are built-in to check for syntax errors.
- **Reporting**: QA analysts will run tests and receive reports in real-time, recorded in Local Storage for future reference.
- **User Management**: Project managers can create user groups and assign access rights, with the Local Storage retaining this data securely.

## 4. Security Considerations
- Ensure any sensitive information stored in Local Storage is minimally necessary and obfuscated.
- Implement **client-side encryption** for sensitive data to enhance security.
  
## 5. Performance Considerations
- Utilize efficient DOM manipulation methods to avoid performance bottlenecks in rendering the UI.
- Keep Local Storage access minimized during active user interactions to improve responsiveness.

## 6. Usability Enhancements
- Implement a responsive design compatible with mobile devices, ensuring ease of use across platforms.
- Comprehensive inline help documents or pop-ups will guide users in navigating the product.

## 7. Conclusion
The proposed architecture of the "Test" tool will deliver an intuitive testing solution with all data managed in the browser's Local Storage. This approach keeps the design lightweight and directly facilitates the objectives set out in the PRD, fostering an environment where software teams can efficiently manage their testing workflows.
