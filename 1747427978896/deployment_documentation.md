# Deployment Documentation for Test Automation Tool

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to deploy the Test Automation Tool to GitHub Pages, ensuring a clear understanding of the deployment process.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a GitHub account and a repository created for this project.
- You should have all necessary code in the output/build directory ready for deployment.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare the Build Directory**  
   Ensure that the project has been built and the compiled files are available in the output/build directory. This can typically be done using your preferred build tool (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, etc.).

2. **Push the Code to GitHub**  
   If the code isn't already pushed to your GitHub repository, do the following:
   - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
   - Initialize a Git repository (if not done already):
     ```
     git init
     ```
   - Add your remote repository:
     ```
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
     ```
   - Add all files and commit:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit or your commit message"
     ```
   - Push the changes to GitHub:
     ```
     git push -u origin main
     ```

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**  
   Once the code is successfully pushed to GitHub, deploy the site using GitHub Pages:
   ```
   Deploy to Github Pages
   ```
   - Input: 
   ```json
   {
     "build_path": "output/build"
   }
   ```
   - Wait for the deployment process to complete successfully.

4. **Access the Deployed Site**  
   After successful deployment, your site should be accessible at the following URL:
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepository/
   ```

## Conclusion
Following these steps will ensure that the Test Automation Tool is correctly deployed on GitHub Pages, allowing users to access the tool directly from their web browsers. Always remember to pull the latest changes from the repository before making further modifications and redeployments.
