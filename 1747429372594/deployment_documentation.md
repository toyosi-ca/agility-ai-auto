# Deployment Documentation for Test Management Application

## Overview
This document outlines the steps necessary to deploy the Test Management Application to GitHub Pages from the output/build directory.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have your project set up and code written as per your specifications.
- You must have a GitHub account and a repository created for your project.
- The `output/build` directory should contain the compiled and ready-to-deploy application files.

## Steps for Deployment

1. **Build the Project:**
   Ensure that you have built your project which generates an `output/build` directory. This step typically involves running a build tool such as Webpack, Parcel, etc.

2. **Push the Code to GitHub:**
   Before deploying to GitHub Pages, you have to push your code to your GitHub repository. This can usually be done through Git commands, but in this case, we will use the specified method.

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   Use the following tool to deploy the frontend code to GitHub Pages:
   ```json
   {
       "build_path": "output/build"
   }
   ```
   This command deploys the contents of your `output/build` directory directly to your GitHub Pages.

4. **Verification:**
   After successfully deploying, visit your GitHub Pages URL to verify the application is running as expected. The URL typically follows the structure:
   ```
   https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```

## Conclusion
Following these steps, the Test Management Application is now deployed to GitHub Pages. Modify your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed. After any changes, ensure to rebuild the project and redeploy to reflect updates.
