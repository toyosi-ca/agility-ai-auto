## 1. Introduction
This document aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive software architecture for the "Test" product based on the product requirements document (PRD). The solution outlined here is entirely frontend-focused, utilizing the local storage API for data persistence.

## 2. Architecture Overview
The architecture of the "Test" product is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React. The structure leverages component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability. The app will be structured into multiple modules to handle different features of the system.

## 3. Components
### 3.1 Component Breakdown
- **App Component**
  - Entry point of the application, handles routing and state management.
  
- **User Management Module**
  - **Registration Component:** Form for new users to create accounts using email.
  - **Login Component:** Allows users to log in with email and password. 
  - **Recovery Component:** Functionality for password recovery.

- **Test Creation Module**
  - **Test Builder Component:** User-friendly interface to build tests using drag-and-drop functionality.
  - **Question Component:** Individual components for each question type (Multiple Choice, True/False, etc.).
  - **Template Component:** Pre-defined templates for rapid test creation.

- **Test Administration Module**
  - **Scheduler Component:** Manage test availability through a user interface.
  - **Settings Component:** Allows customizing test options such as randomizing questions and setting timers.

- **User Experience Module**
  - **Dashboard Component:** Displays an overview of user tests, performance metrics, and analytics.
  - **Responsive Layout:** Ensures that the application is mobile-friendly.

- **Analytics and Reporting Module**
  - **Performance Metrics Component:** Presents user performance reports and statistics.
  - **Export Component:** Allows exporting data (imaginary interface for CSV/PDF but will only show for UI).

### 3.2 Local Storage Use
Local storage will be employed for:
- Storing user registration data and session tokens for persistent logins.
- Saving created tests and user responses temporarily.
- Keeping the settings preferences of the users.

### 3.3 Component Hierarchy
```plaintext
App
├─ UserManagement
│  ├─ Registration
│  ├─ Login
│  └─ Recovery
├─ TestCreation
│  ├─ TestBuilder
│  │  ├─ Question
│  │  └─ Template
│  └─ Scheduler
│  └─ Settings
├─ UserExperience
│  └─ Dashboard
├─ Analytics
│  ├─ PerformanceMetrics
│  └─ Export
```

## 4. Implementation Details
### 4.1 State Management
The application will use React’s Context API or Prop drilling for state management, allowing for easy accessibility to shared state across various components.

### 4.2 Styling
To maintain a consistent and visually appealing interface, CSS Modules or any CSS-in-JS library (like styled-components) will be used.

### 4.3 Responsive Design
The design will follow a mobile-first approach employing Flexbox and Grid layouts for a responsive user experience.

### 4.4 Routing
React Router will be used for navigation between components. The routes will be set for:
- `/register` for registration
- `/login` for login
- `/test-builder` for test creation
- `/dashboard` for user dashboard

## 5. Testing Strategy
### 5.1 Unit Testing
Jest and React Testing Library will be used for unit testing components to ensure that they function as intended.

### 5.2 Integration Testing
Integration tests for assessing interactions between components will also be conducted.

### 5.3 User Testing
Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on usability, iterating on designs based on user feedback to improve functionality.

## 6. Deployment
The deployment process will use static site hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify to ensure easy access and quick iterations. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices may be introduced later.

## 7. Conclusion
The architecture designed for the "Test" product is meant to provide a user-friendly, scalable, and efficient platform for creating and managing tests. By utilizing only frontend technologies and local storage, this architecture adheres to the constraints defined in the product requirements document while aiming to deliver a robust solution that fulfills user needs.

## 8. Next Steps
- Set up the project environment.
- Begin implementation following the described architecture and component breakdown.
- Regularly engage stakeholders for feedback throughout the development process.
